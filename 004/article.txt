If I were to leave my home for a year, there is one thing I definitely would take with me: my cellphone. With my cell phone, I could call my friends or family if I ever was lonely, needed advice,or just wanted to talk.

　　If I were away from home for a year, I would be very lonely, especially in the beginning before Imade friends. If I could call my mother and father, I would hear their familiar voices and I wouldnot feel so lonely. Hearing my friends’ voices would also help me overcome my sadness.

　　I’ve never been on my own so there are many things I am not familiar with. I’ve never opened abank account, got a driver’s license, or made my own food. If I had to cook chicken orsomething, I could call up my mother and she could tell me how to make dinner.

　　Sometimes, I may just want to talk in my own language. With my cell phone, I could call myfriends and tell them about my new life. This would make them jealous of me. I would call thema lot so they could hear all the wonderful things I am doing.

　　For me a cell phone is a necessity. I would need it anytime I was lonely, anytime I needed to dosomething I didn’t know how to do, and anytime I just wanted to talk. Of course, the phone billwill be sent to my parents.
